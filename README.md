## SATH
 This script is designed to convert auth.log files into CSV format, specifically extracting details from SSH login attempts. It captures essential information such as timestamp, hostname, service name, process ID, status (failed or accepted), username, source IP, source port, and a detailed message. This conversion makes it easier to analyze authentication logs using spreadsheet software or other CSV-compatible tools.
